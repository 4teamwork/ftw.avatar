2.1.0 (2019-06-17)

  access. [phgross]


2.0.1 (2016-08-12)
------------------

- Fix aggressive caching of the portrait image by not considering the modified

  [mbaechtold]


2.0.0 (2016-06-01)
------------------

- Changed utility method IAvatarGenerator.generate to take userid instead of full name.
